# Arabic Sentiment Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify Arabic tweets into sentiment categories, either positive or negative, using TensorFlow.

## Dataset
The dataset combines Arabic tweets and Youtube comments from two different sources, enhancing the diversity and representativeness of our training data. This serves as a solid foundation for training our model to accurately understand and predict the sentiment of unseen Arabic texts.

- **Dataset Sources:**
  - [Tweet Sentiment Multilingual Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual)
  - [DZ Sentiment YT Comments Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Abdou/dz-sentiment-yt-comments)

## Prerequisites
To set up your environment to run the project, install the required libraries using the command below:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Model Performance
The current iteration of the model achieves an accuracy of 71%, which indicates there is significant room for improvement. This performance metric underscores the challenges inherent in sentiment classification for Arabic texts. I acknowledge the need for further enhancements and plan to revisit and refine the model in the future, aiming for a higher accuracy score.
